# Contents of this Repository
The subject "Theory and Applications of Digital Image processing" explores the area of Digital Image Processing. The lecture follows the Image processing pipeline and covers a wide range of topics ranging from Image acquisition to final classification. The sequence to be followed when studying with this repository is as follows:

1. Optics
2. Signal Therory and Linear filters
3. Digital Filters and Morphology
4. Noise Suppresion and Edge Enhancement
5. Segmentation and Edge Extraction
6. Texture Analysis and feature extraction
7. Classification
8. Colour Image Processing

The subject contains intuitive topics which the professor tries to co-relate with our day-to-day scenarios. Although the subject requires a conceptual knowledge of Signal theory, there are many articles and YouTube channels which I would recommend watching when studying for the subject. 

The Professor tries to explain things in a much simpler manner and since his expertise in the domain of Driver Assistence systems at Robert Bosch GmbH, his examples are inclined towards this domain. 

I would highly recommend attending his classes to learn more about the area of Digital Image Processing.
